## Contributors

Contributors are currently are students in both the Computer and Systems Science programs but all are welcome. Putting together proper contributor guidelines and workflow recommendations is a high priority, and is currently active. Before contributing please refer to the following articles:

* [Work with Github Issues and Pull Requests](http://docs.geonode.org/en/master/organizational/contribute/work_with_github.html){:target="_blank"}
* [How to Write a Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/){:target="_blank"}

These will be especially useful if you are new to git and Github collaboration, otherwise they should be a review of Best Practices the Project strives toward.

In addition, while we work to adopt a formal Code of Conduct, please do your best to give others the benefit of the doubt and adhere to the Inverse Golden Rule: *Do not unto others that which you would not have done unto you*.

The project repository can be found at [https://github.com/occam-ra/occam](https://github.com/occam-ra/occam) and should include increasingly more technical documentation.

Take a look at [the good first issues](https://github.com/occam-ra/occam/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22){:target="_blank"} to jump right in.

The repository for this website can be found at [https://github.com/occam-ra/occam-ra.github.io](https://github.com/occam-ra/occam-ra.github.io), any Issues and Pull Requests on usability, accessibility, content proofing, etc. are also appreciated.
